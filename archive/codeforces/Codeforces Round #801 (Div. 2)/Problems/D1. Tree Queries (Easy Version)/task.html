  <p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">The only difference between this problem and D2 is the bound on the size of the tree.</span></p>
  <p>You are given an unrooted tree with $n$ vertices. There is some hidden vertex $x$ in that tree that you are trying to find.</p>
  <p>To do this, you may ask $k$ queries $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$ where the $v_i$ are vertices in the tree. After you are finished asking all of the queries, you are given $k$ numbers $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$, where $d_i$ is the number of edges on the shortest path between $v_i$ and $x$. Note that you know which distance corresponds to which query.</p>
  <p>What is the minimum $k$ such that there exists some queries $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$ that let you always uniquely identify $x$ (no matter what $x$ is).</p>
  <p>Note that you don't actually need to output these queries.</p>

  <p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.</p>
  <p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2000$) &nbsp;â€” the number of vertices in the tree.</p>
  <p>Each of the next $n-1$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$), meaning there is an edges between vertices $x$ and $y$ in the tree.</p>
  <p>It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p>
  <p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2000$.</p>

  <p>In the first test case, there is only one vertex, so you don't need any queries.</p>
  <p>In the second test case, you can ask a single query about the node $1$. Then, if $x = 1$, you will get $0$, otherwise you will get $1$.</p>
