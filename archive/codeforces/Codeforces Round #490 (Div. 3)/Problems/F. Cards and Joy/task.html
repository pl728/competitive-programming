  <p>There are $n$ players sitting at the card table. Each player has a favorite number. The favorite number of the $j$-th player is $f_j$.</p>
  <p>There are $k \cdot n$ cards on the table. Each card contains a single integer: the $i$-th card contains number $c_i$. Also, you are given a sequence $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_k$. Its meaning will be explained below.</p>
  <p>The players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them will hold exactly $k$ cards. After all the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number. The joy level of a player equals $h_t$ if the player holds $t$ cards containing his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite number (i.e., $t=0$), his joy level is $0$.</p>
  <p>Print the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the sequence $h_1, \dots, h_k$ is the same for all the players.</p>

   Input
  </div>
  <p>The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 500, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the number of players and the number of cards each player will get.</p>
  <p>The second line contains $k \cdot n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{k \cdot n}$ ($1 \le c_i \le 10^5$) — the numbers written on the cards.</p>
  <p>The third line contains $n$ integers $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$ ($1 \le f_j \le 10^5$) — the favorite numbers of the players.</p>
  <p>The fourth line contains $k$ integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_k$ ($1 \le h_t \le 10^5$), where $h_t$ is the joy level of a player if he gets exactly $t$ cards with his favorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition $h_{t - 1} &lt; h_t$ holds for each $t \in [2..k]$.</p>

   Note
  </div>
  <p>In the first example, one possible optimal card distribution is the following:</p>
  <ul> 
   <li> Player $1$ gets cards with numbers $[1, 3, 8]$; </li>
   <li> Player $2$ gets cards with numbers $[2, 2, 8]$; </li>
   <li> Player $3$ gets cards with numbers $[2, 2, 8]$; </li>
   <li> Player $4$ gets cards with numbers $[5, 5, 5]$. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the answer is $2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 21$.</p>
  <p>In the second example, no player can get a card with his favorite number. Thus, the answer is $0$.</p>
