  <p>The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!</p>
  <p>Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!</p>
  <p>The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.</p>
  <p>The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.</p>

   Input
  </div>
  <p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10$).</p>
  <p>Each of the following $4n + 1$ lines contains two integers $x_i, y_i$ ($0 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 50$), describing the coordinates of the next point.</p>
  <p>It is guaranteed that there are at least $n$ points on each side of the square and all $4n + 1$ points are distinct.</p>

   Output

  <p>Print two integers&nbsp;â€” the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.</p>
