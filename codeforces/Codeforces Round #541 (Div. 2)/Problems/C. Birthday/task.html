  <p>Cowboy Vlad has a birthday today! There are $n$ children who came to the celebration. In order to greet Vlad, the children decided to form a circle around him. Among the children who came, there are both tall and low, so if they stand in a circle arbitrarily, it may turn out, that there is a tall and low child standing next to each other, and it will be difficult for them to hold hands. Therefore, children want to stand in a circle so that the maximum difference between the growth of two neighboring children would be minimal possible.</p>
  <p>Formally, let's number children from $1$ to $n$ in a circle order, that is, for every $i$ child with number $i$ will stand next to the child with number $i+1$, also the child with number $1$ stands next to the child with number $n$. Then we will call the discomfort of the circle the maximum absolute difference of heights of the children, who stand next to each other.</p>
  <p>Please help children to find out how they should reorder themselves, so that the resulting discomfort is smallest possible.</p>

  <p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100$)&nbsp;— the number of the children who came to the cowboy Vlad's birthday.</p>
  <p>The second line contains integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) denoting heights of every child.</p>

   Output
  </div>
  <p>Print exactly $n$ integers&nbsp;— heights of the children in the order in which they should stand in a circle. You can start printing a circle with any child.</p>
  <p>If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.</p>

   Note
  </div>
  <p>In the first example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to $1$, since the corresponding absolute differences are $1$, $1$, $1$ and $0$. Note, that sequences $[2, 3, 2, 1, 1]$ and $[3, 2, 1, 1, 2]$ form the same circles and differ only by the selection of the starting point.</p>
  <p>In the second example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to $20$, since the absolute difference of $10$ and $30$ is equal to $20$.</p>
