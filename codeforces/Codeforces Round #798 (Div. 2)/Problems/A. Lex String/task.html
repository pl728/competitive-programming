  <p><span class="tex-font-style-it">Kuznecov likes art, poetry, and music. And strings consisting of lowercase English letters.</span></p>
  <p>Recently, Kuznecov has found two strings, $a$ and $b$, of lengths $n$ and $m$ respectively. They consist of lowercase English letters and <span class="tex-font-style-bf">no character is contained in both strings</span>. </p>
  <p>Let another string $c$ be initially empty. Kuznecov can do the following two types of operations:</p>
  <ul> 
   <li> Choose any character from the string $a$, remove it from $a$, and add it to the end of $c$. </li>
   <li> Choose any character from the string $b$, remove it from $b$, and add it to the end of $c$. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>But, he can not do more than $k$ operations of the same type in a row. He must perform operations until either $a$ or $b$ becomes empty. What is the lexicographically smallest possible value of $c$ after he finishes?</p>
  <p>A string $x$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $y$ if and only if one of the following holds:</p>
  <ul>
   <li> $x$ is a prefix of $y$, but $x \neq y$; </li>
   <li> in the first position where $x$ and $y$ differ, the string $x$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $y$.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description.</p>
  <p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($1\leq n,m,k \leq 100$)&nbsp;— parameters from the statement.</p>
  <p>The second line of each test case contains the string $a$ of length $n$.</p>
  <p>The third line of each test case contains the string $b$ of length $m$. </p>
  <p>The strings contain only lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that no symbol appears in $a$ and $b$ simultaneously.</p>

  <p>In the first test case, it is optimal to take two '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">a</span>'s from the string $a$ and add them to the string $c$. Then it is forbidden to take more characters from $a$, hence one character '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">b</span>' from the string $b$ has to be taken. Following that logic, we end up with $c$ being '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">aabaabaa</span>' when string $a$ is emptied.</p>
  <p>In the second test case it is optimal to take as many '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">a</span>'s from string $a$ as possible, then take as many '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">b</span>'s as possible from string $b$. In the end, we take two '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">c</span>'s from the string $a$ emptying it. </p>
